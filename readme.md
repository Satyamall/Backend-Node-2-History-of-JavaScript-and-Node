### History of JavaScript and Node: 

<h1>1- History of JavaScript: <h1>

<h4> JavaScript / ECMAScript <h4>

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).

Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

<h4> The ECMA Technical Committee 39 <h4>

In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language.

ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.

<h4> From ES4 to ES6 <h4>

When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps:

The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp:
 -Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

The ECMAScript 4 Camp:
 -Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.

August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email:

It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.

The solution was to work together:

 -ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5
 -ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3.
 -Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.
 -TC39 should develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5.
The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split it created?).

ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully compliant by July 2013:

Chrome 23	IE10 / Edge	Firefox 21	Safari 6	Opera 15
Nov 2012	Sep 2012	May 2013	Jul 2012	Jul 2013

ES6 was also a huge success. It was released in 2015, and all major browsers were fully compliant by March 2017:

				
Chrome 51	Edge 14	Firefox 52	Safari 10	Opera 38
May 2016	Aug 2016	Mar 2017	Sep 2016	Jun 2016

<h1> 2- History of Node <h1>

Believe it or not, Node.js is only 12 years old.

In comparison, JavaScript is 26 years old and the Web is 33 years old.

JavaScript is a programming language that was created at Netscape as a scripting tool to manipulate web pages inside their browser, Netscape Navigator.

<h3> A little bit of history <h3>

Part of the business model of Netscape was to sell Web Servers, which included an environment called Netscape LiveWire that could create dynamic pages using server-side JavaScript. Unfortunately, Netscape LiveWire wasn't very successful and server-side JavaScript wasn't popularized until recently, by the introduction of Node.js.

One key factor that led to the rise of Node.js was the timing. Just a few years earlier, JavaScript had started to be considered as a more serious language, thanks to "Web 2.0" applications (such as Flickr, Gmail, etc.) that showed the world what a modern experience on the web could be like.

JavaScript engines also became considerably better as many browsers competed to offer users the best performance. Development teams behind major browsers worked hard to offer better support for JavaScript and find ways to make JavaScript run faster. The engine that Node.js uses under the hood, V8 (also known as Chrome V8 for being the open-source JavaScript engine of The Chromium Project), improved significantly due to this competition.

Node.js happened to be built in the right place and right time, but luck isn't the only reason why it is popular today. It introduces a lot of innovative thinking and approaches for JavaScript server-side development that have already helped many developers.
